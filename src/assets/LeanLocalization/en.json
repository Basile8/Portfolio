The game is called 'Allez mon Poulain', and is accessible via browser for computers or downloadable for Android phones. The aim is to create your character, and take on various opponents to win gold and experience. Each level offers new skills, and allows your character to specialize in 4 elemental types: Fire, Water, Ground and Lightning, each with its own specificity. A newly implemented inventory and store system allows for further character specialization.",
