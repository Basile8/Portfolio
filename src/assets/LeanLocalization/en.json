Specialized in backend development, I also like to improve on other technologies like Angular for frontend development. My aim is to create robust, high-performance solutions while continuing to develop my skills in various areas of development. Aside from coding, I like to play video games, and I usually go in for a workout several times a week, which allows me to burn off some energy and take my mind off things. Looking forward to meeting you !"
